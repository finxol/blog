    You thought Github was a social coding platform? Think again, get ready to tangle!
    Built on atproto, tangled allows you to use your Bluesky identity on a (not quite yet) fully feldged git platform!

I recently set up my own atproto PDS, for use with Bluesky and all other atproto apps.
If you already feel lost, check out last week's post where I wuickly explain what atproto is,
roughly how it works, and the steps I followed to get my PDS running.

Embracing ATProto, part 1: Setting up a PDS
::

The PDS setup was an overall very smooth process.
Bluesky and the AT Protocol are backed and built by a very competent team of well funded engineers for a few years already.

## What's tangled?

Tangled, on the other hand, was started only about 8 months ago, at the start of 2025 by [two](https://tangled.sh/@oppi.li) [brothers](https://tangled.sh/@icyphox.sh).
It's a "social-enabled git collaboration platform"

The platform has gained a lot of traction since, and the community is very much involved in the development, but for now tangled is still in alpha.
That doesn't mean it's not usable yet.


### What's a Knot?

Just like plain atproto, tangled has some lingo of its own.

In tangled, a knot is essentially a git server.
It's sort of like an atproto PDS in the sense that it's where your data—here your code—lives.

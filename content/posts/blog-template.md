## Architecture

This blog is built using Nuxt, Tailwind, and Markdown, via the Nuxt Content module.
The template is built so that you can easily customize it to fit your needs.

All configuration and values for the blog live inside the `blog.config.ts` file.
There, you can customize the blog's title, description, author, links, and other settings.

All the posts are stored in the `content/posts` directory.
You can add new posts by creating new markdown files in this directory.
The contents of the About and Home pages are stored in the `content/pages` directory.

More explanation and details will come later in the README.md of the template repo.

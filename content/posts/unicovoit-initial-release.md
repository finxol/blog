I often use carpooling applications to get home to my parents.
At my university, there is a student group chat that allows students to exchange and in particular to get in touch with travelers for carpooling.

The process is quite cumbersome, only works if the driver sees the message before it gets lost in other conversations, and only reaches a small group of people.

An idea then crossed my mind.
It would be much easier to have an app like BlaBlaCar,
but only between students and without the heavy fees charged by the company.

So began the IUCovoit project, a contraction of the words IUT and Carpooling, later renamed UniCovoit, more inclusive of any university.

I started working on the project a couple of weeks after getting the idea, just the time to let it settle in my head.
I was also motivated by the fact that I had to isolate for a week after testing positive for Covid-19.
Though times, they were...

During that week, I spent basically every woken hour learning how to use Nuxt 2 and Vuetify.
I chose these technologies for the very simple reason that someone at my university had used them extensively to build a website to access our timetables easier, which meant I had an exit strategy in case I got hopelessly stuck.
I've got to say that was a pretty good idea for the beginning, it came in handy a couple times.

When I finally got out, I continued working on the project, just not so intensively.

I had to pause the work a few times as well because of uni work, ugh 😒.

Then came the summer break, which weren't much of a break for the most part, as I was working tirelessly on UniCovoit.
I wanted to be ready for a big launch at the beginning of September when we go back to university.

While working over the summer was definitely worth it and I managed to finish everything on time, I am absolutely exhausted for September.

Nonetheless, I am very proud to announce that UniCovoit is now open for business! (not literally business, I don't actually make any money)

I'm Colin Ozanne, aka finxol. On this blog I write about tech stuff I find interesting.
I also have a [travel blog](https://colinswanderlustchronicles.com/) I've written a fair bit for.

I'm still a student so I don't have heaps to show for myself yet, but some good stuff is yet to come.<br>
Among the few things I can share, I've built a complete [carpool platform for students](https://github.com/unicovoit/unicovoit).

Staying on the topic of carpool platforms, I'm currently building a federated carpool platform called [Karr](https://karr.mobi/?utm_source=finxol-blog&utm_content=about-page).
It's still in very early days though, so there isn't much to show off yet.

Last potentially interesting thing is my [portfolio](https://colinozanne.fr).
I've kept it up to date, but haven't actively worked on it in a couple of years but it still looks decent.

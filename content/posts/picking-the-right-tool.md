All the ["Just Fucking use HTML"](https://justfuckingusehtml.com/) noise is quite aggressive and hard to ignore.
I think they've got a point, but that point lacks nuance.
There's a reason more complex tools were built and are as popular as they are.

Let's dive into simplicity, complexity and tooling.

## The case for plain HTML

simpler is often better, if it can get the job done.
no need to introduce complexity when it's not actually needed.

increased overhead can easily lead to worse perf.

simple things keep things simple.
no need for build steps or complex deployments.

## The case for more complex tooling

plain html is ugly.
css is hard.

dx is also important.

## Exceptions

Now, if you're a nerd like me—which you probably are if you're reading this—there's some tools you want to use just because they seem cool,
not necessarily because they're needed.

I think that's a valid exception to the "pick the right tool for the job" rule.
For our little projects no one else will realistically ever use or contribute to, who cares if you're massively over-engineering
or bringing in useless complexity?

But then ultimately, just use whatever makes your life easier to make a good user experience,
because that's what really matters in the end.
